                On his wounded fifth album, Mac Miller sings deftly about heartbreak and his mental state, 
                capturing his resignation without turning sadness into a performative spectacle.
                One of the main messages behind the album is self-love, personal healing, and psychological growth.
                <br>
                <br>
                The 2018 album was Miller’s fifth studio album, the last album released before his death on 
                Sept. 7, 2018. The coroner found fentanyl, cocaine and alcohol in his body and concluded that 
                the cause of death was an accidental overdose.
                <br>
                <br>
                When Ariana Grande left Mac Miller in spring 2018, he lost a relationship, a collaborator, 
                and muse. Miller’s 2016 effort The Divine Feminine was recorded closely with Grande and 
                doubled as a love letter to the woman he’d hitched his star to. He’s gone from “you and 
                me against the world” to just “me against the world,” and as much as he tries to convince 
                himself that’s almost as good on his warm but wounded fifth album, Swimming, he knows it’s not.
                <br>
                <br>
                With the album coming out after his breakup with singer Ariana Grande and his 2018 DUI arrest, 
                the album portrays him trying to swim away from his broken heart and struggles rather than drown 
                in them.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of the main messages behind the album is self-love, personal healing, and psychological
                growth, and the song that portrays this message the most is “Self Care.”
                What Miller was trying to say through this is that we have to take care of ourselves before we can worry about other people. You have to find yourself before you can be there for someone else.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another lyric from “Self Care” that sticks out to me is when Miller says “The sun set quickly 
                then get up slow, yeah, I disconnect and upload.” What I take from this is that sometimes, you 
                have to disconnect yourself from the world around you and focus on yourself. People require some 
                time to ponder things and make sure they’re doing fine mentally and that’s the battle Miller is 
                fighting throughout the song.
                <br>
                <br>
                During the telling of this story, Miller, who also handled production himself, masterfully 
                portrays this story with his production, taking us through multiple genres throughout the album. 
                While “Jet Fuel” has a sluggish, trip-hop vibe, “What’s the Use?” has a more upbeat synth-funk 
                groove.
                <br>
                <br>
                At its lightest, Swimming plays a little like Mac Miller’s own Forgetting Sarah Marshall, an 
                amiable account of involuntary bachelorhood. “I know I probably need to do better, fuck whoever, 
                keep my shit together,” he ambles over an aloof beat on “Smaller Worlds.” On “What’s the Use,” 
                he shrugs off his foibles over some buoyant roller-disco, accompanied by low-key vocal assists from 
                Snoop Dogg and Thundercat. Miller’s flow is limber and self-deprecating; he tries any pattern of 
                singing or rapping that might lift his spirits for a few seconds. He’s doing his best to find the 
                humor in a situation that isn’t really funny, as his arrest for a DUI and hit and run in May 2018 made 
                all too clear.
                <br>
                <br>
                Miller has long been open about his struggles with addiction, which Grande cited in her decision 
                to end what she called a “toxic relationship.” But those looking for any dirt-dishing or ax-grinding 
                on Swimming will be disappointed. “Everybody want a headline, I don’t got nothin’ to say,” he 
                rapped on “Programs,” a loose track from May with more of a chip on its shoulder than any that 
                made the album. Even at Swimming’s bleakest—“Self Care/Oblivion,” a dispiriting account of his 
                pain-numbing regime, or “Hurt Feelings,” which shines some light on his mental state during that 
                DUI—Miller resists the suggestion that anybody in particular is to blame for him bottoming out. 
                The furthest he’ll go is acknowledging life was a lot easier with Grande than without her. 
                “She put me back together when I was out of order,” he admits on “Perfecto.”
                <br>
                <br>
                This sort of heartsick longing is not exactly something new—in 2018, you can’t toss a stone 
                without it landing in some chart-topping sad rapper’s styrofoam cup. But Miller explores his 
                headspace with considerably more focus than Drake, Future, or Post Malone, artists who sometimes 
                cut emotional corners in their rush to the next banger. An album with nothing but time on its 
                hands and an understanding that healing is a slow, tedious process, Swimming is most engaging 
                when it details the simple things Miller tells himself to keep his spirits up. “Every day 
                I wake up and breathe/I don’t have it all but that’s all right with me,” he sighs on “2009,” 
                even though he only sounds half-convinced.
                <br>
                <br>
                He’s come a long way since his overbearing kid brother act of his early Blue Slide Park days. 
                Where he used to mug over his music relentlessly, on Swimming he mostly lets the beats breathe, 
                clearing ample space for the record’s peaceful orchestral swells and blushing keyboards. 
                He’s also singing more than ever, and he sounds better than ever doing it. Modest as it is, 
                his voice is expressive in ways his plainspoken prose could never be, capturing his resignation 
                without turning sadness into a performative spectacle.
                <br>
                <br>
                As always, Miller remains a step behind the prestige artists he emulates—Chance the Rapper, 
                Anderson.Paak, and, increasingly, Frank Ocean, whose nonchalant songcraft looms large here.
                Swimming is less virtuosic than those artists’ recent works, but no less heartfelt, and the album’s 
                wistful soul and warm funk fits Miller like his oldest, coziest hoodie. He may be unable to escape 
                his own head, as he laments on the opener “Come Back to Earth,” but he’s decided to make himself 
                as comfortable as possible while he’s trapped there.   
                <br>
                <br>
                The production and the messages behind the album were impactful, and it showed, as the album was 
                nominated for Rap Album of the Year in 2019, losing to Cardi B’s “Invasion of Privacy.”
                <br>
                <br>
                However, this album was still the most inspirational album of that year to me, as I hold
                on to a lot of the messages Miller conveyed in the album.
                <br>
                <br>
                What I learned from this project is that instead of drowning in my thoughts and misery,
                I need to get through them and swim to shore. To do that, sometimes it’s going to require 
                me to choose myself over others and give myself some time to take care of me. Rest In Peace Mac.
